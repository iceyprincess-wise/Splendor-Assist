/*
 * Keeps the tracked picture of the pitch between frames.
 *
 * REPAIRED (Task B): removed the zombie refresh that stamped whatever track
 * happened to be LAST in the list with a fresh lastSeenFrame + the global
 * scene confidence every frame - it kept one arbitrary ghost alive forever
 * and corrupted its confidence. Added a sanity cap on simultaneous tracks
 * (a real match cannot exceed ~22 entities + margin): kept tracks are the
 * freshest/strongest, so detector noise from crowd pixels can no longer
 * inflate the count past VisionTrust's sanity line and lock the whole
 * contributor stack out. Memory frames + cap answer the admin store live.
